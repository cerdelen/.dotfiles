To use Icons I have to install a NerdFont and set the Terminal emulator to use it

to install NerdFont

"brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts"

"brew install --cask <font_name>"
(I'm using "font-meslo-lg-nerd-font")
Font Location
    Linux = "~/.local/share/fonts"
    macOS = "~/Library/Fonts"
    Windows = "OMEGALUL"
